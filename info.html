        <p>Directions / user info: Drag and drop the arrows to change the order of the letters.  The order is being saved, but note there is some chance that someone else is changing 
        the order at the same time.  That is, I did not protect this with a cookie or session.  Thus, if you refresh, you won't necessarily get the 
        order you saved.
