    <h1>drag and drop info</h1>

    <p>My <a href='drag.html'>drag and drop widget</a> / example / coming client-side JavaScript library.

    </p>

    <p>Directions / user info: Drag and drop the arrows to change the order of the letters.  The order is being saved, but note there is some chance 
        that someone else is changing 
    the order at the same time.  That is, I did not protect this with a cookie or session.  Thus, if you refresh, you won't necessarily get the 
    order you saved. 
    </p>

    <p>Also, saving the order will eventually break because the ordering floating point numbers will eventually underflow the smallest possible 
        size.  For my main use case, I am fine with this because the chance of an underflow I put at around 0.01% over the next few years of use.
        In this use case, I can live with those odds.  The project's budget is not high enough to worry about such things.  
     </p>
     
     <p>To solve the problem, the server could check for a certain size, lock a resource lock / semaphore / mutex, and then multiply all the 
         relevant 
         rows (documents) by a billion or more, then release the lock.
     </p>
     
     <p>I think the PHP language is the weakest link for an underflow.  Client-size JavaScript says it can handle 5e-324, which is a 
         mind-bogglingly small number.  I'm not sure what MongoDB can handle.  PHP can handle about 14 significant digits.  
         
     </p>
     
     <p>After I wrote the above, I increased the default base number in the example by several orders of magnitude.  It will still break 
         eventually. I'll leave that experimentation, research, and math to the reader.

    <h2>purpose</h2>
    
    <p>I'm trying to create a drag and drop client-side JavaScript library with the following features:</p>
    
    <ul>
        
        <li>Arrow icons represent the draggable HTML elements.</li>
        
        <li>Dragged elements may drag other, associated elements, and then drop them in a different order than when the drag started.
            
        </li>
        
        <li>While one is dragging an element, the code indicates where that element will be positioned if it were dropped at that point.</li>
        
        <li>Order is indicated (behind the scenes) by a floating point number that is between the numbers of the adjacent elements.  The top 
            is 0 and thus the order number must remain greater than 0.  The bottom element always has the highest number.
            
        </li>
        
        <li>This order representation means that upon drop, only the new order number has to be saved to the server.  The entire order does not have to 
            be saved.
            
        </li>
        
        <li>Upon drop, drag is disabled and a transition is indicated until the server returns "OK."  
            
        </li>
        
    </ul>
    
    <p>It appears that I can abstract the library so that it will work in many instances.  I won't know how well the abstraction works until I 
        try it in a second instance.  I plan to do this late on June 25, 2022, or soon after.

    <h2>background</h2>

    <p>Early on June 23, 2022, I was working on my main client's application.  To go back a few years, in 2017, he asked for a drag and drop feature 
        on one of the pages.  
        (Specifying the page possibly is a secret.)
        Once 
        that was working, he wanted the drag motion to indicate where the row would go if it were dropped in that position.  That's where I get this 
        version's dashed, 4px wide border.  A year ago, I added another drag feature.  That one isn't a secret.  There are account numbers 
        associated with one or more court docket numbers.  He wanted to be able to drag the account number to specify which one would be billed--the one 
        on top.  
    </p>
        
    <p>For the last 7 months or so I've been reworking the whole application to free it from Drupal.  When I was reworking the original drag and drop 
        page, I decided to rework a number of points beyond escaping Drupal.  On the "secret" page, a drop can cause a few dozen fields to recalculate.  
        Previously, I was saving all those fields, and I had to make sure that the saves didn't get out of order in terms of which got to the server 
        first.  I realized a few weeks ago that I only need to save the order and one other field.  I don't need to save those fields on the back end 
        because based on one field and order, the rest of the fields are derivable.  I don't have to worry about network order because I disable 
        drag until the server returns "OK."  
        
    </p>
    
    <p>The other night I was reworking the account number drag feature, and I decided to change it to work the same way with an order number.  I 
        decided to stop the billing clock and create a public library, then use that library for the new account number feature.  I won't know 
        how abstract the library is until I try to use it in my client's application.
